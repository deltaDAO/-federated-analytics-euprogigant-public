## 3. Recipients and cross-border data transfer

**Visiting and using our demonstrator**  
When visiting and using our demonstrator, your IP address is processed by Netlify, a service provider that hosts our demonstrator. Our demonstrator is served by Netlify using a Content Delivery Network, a geographically distributed network, with servers within and outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). This means, if you are located within the EEA, your IP address will most likely (but not guaranteed) be processed on a Netlify server within the EEA. 

There is no adequacy decision for the USA from the European Commission. Our cooperation with Netlify is based on a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) including Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC). You have the right to receive a copy of these SCC. To exercise your right, please contact us at privacy@delta-dao.com.

## 6. Cookies and web storage

A cookie is a small file that stores information in your browser. Your web browser downloads it on the first visit to a website. The next time you open this website with the same device, the cookie and the information stored in it are either sent back to the website that created it (first-party cookie) or sent to another website it belongs to (third-party cookie). This enables the website to detect that you have opened it previously with this browser and, in some cases, to vary the displayed content. Some cookies are necessary for making websites work, and others are used for enhancing your experience on the visited website. Cookies can also be used for marketing, tracking, and analytics purposes. Web storage (local storage and session storage) has similar functionality to cookies.

Our demonstrator **does not use cookies or web storage for marketing, tracking, or analytics purposes**. We use your web storage to remember your page preferences, enable functionalities and to enhance your user experience. Your browser will remove the session storage once you close your browser. You have the option of disabling cookies and deleting cookies and web storage from your computer's hard disk at any time in your browser settings.
